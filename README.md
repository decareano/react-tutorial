React + Firebase Setup

Work done: 
Takeaway 1: We start with hard-coded data and end up with props handling all the data.
Takeway 2: ????
React setup (used create-react-app)
Firebase setup
Authentication (will add authentication in next iterations)
Database: Retrieve and push data

Getting Started
Create your Firebase Project in http://console.firebase.google.com.
Copy config in dashboard's Web Setup and paste to config.js.
Then I initialized the database in the constructor section of App.js.
Created project in github:
> git remote add origin https://github.com/decareano/react-tutorial.git 
> git add .
> git commit 
> git push -u origin master
> git checkout -b develop-branch (to work on features)

React work:

Created App.js (our main file), index.js (entry into the application) and config.js(firebase configuration)
I also created a table.js file to handle the props as well as a form.js to handle changes and submit forms.
In App.js I created a class react component
